# platform137

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.


## CURRENTLY EVERYTHING HAS CUSTOMM SHELL REGEX AND I NEED TO UPDATE THESE DOCS ON HOW PARAMS ARE FIRED INTO BASH SCRIPTS

#### NVIDIA_SMI - nvidia_set.sh
  * p - power draw
  * f - fan speed
  * m - memory transfer rate offset
  * g - graphics clock offset
  * t - temp threshold




#### The Mission
```
  The great mining exodus is amongst us and the numbers will be coming in fast from another popular known L1 named Ethereum. Eth, short for Ethereum, is dominant in the PoW computation battle and has chosen to switch over to PoS. This switch is leading to opportunities to capture and bring over a whole new diverse crowd of folks looking to mine. Bitcoin being ASCII supported isn't welcoming to us little folk as it is dominated by the privileged. The goal here is to make a tool so easy your grandmother could use it to mine. Anyone with a GPU, currently only nvidia, can launch the app and mine away Ergo. Not only can you mine Ergo, you can actively control your fans and clock your system. Not only that but you can do much more. You can set a power threshold so you save your house from being burnt down whilst away for a while. Amazing right? When I first started mining every tool was just okay. You had to run three to four different tools to clock, control fans, set power draws and so much more. Everything here is monolithic in the sense that it is all packaged into one app. Input your address and select a stake pool, then you are good to go! Buy your grandma a GPU because she will be able to start mining. Many things are coming in the future such as mobile connections to mine from the go. Cron-esque tabs for timed mines. From L2 payouts to future L1 to L1 payouts. The great mining exodus is amongst us. Let us build out the hardware to bring over anyone we can and let the little guy take part in mining and produce blocks to secure a decentralized SSI based future.
